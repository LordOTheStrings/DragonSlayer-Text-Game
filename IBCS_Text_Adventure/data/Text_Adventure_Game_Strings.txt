 > You are standing in a dark, cubular cobblestone room. You see a torch near you, lighting up the damp quarters. To your north stands a dark, unforgiving passageway, seemingly descending into nothingness.
 > You enter the corridor. It's pitch black! You could get eaten here, you know.
 > You take the torch from the wall. Great! A light source!
 > With torch in hand, you see a staircase going down into oblivion, blocked by a metal gate. Eerie portraits line the wall, seemingly following you with their eyes.
 > You investigate the portraits further. Upon investigating, you see what appears to be some tearing and torch marks on one.
 > Upon destroying the portrait, you see a hole in the wall, with yellow, bloodshot eyes staring at you. Bursting through the wall, a hobgoblin makes his presence clear.
 > The hobgoblin, not one to mess around with fire, runs away in fear, dropping his weapon.
 > The weapon is a sword. It appears to be of great antiquity, and undecipherable runes run along both sides of the blade. You see the gate open up in front of you, and the staircase is now clear.
 > You descend the staircase, and you find yourself in another room, in the middle of which stands the statue of a manticore. Inscribed on the pedestal beneath it are the words 'leo hac nocte dormit'.
 > The manticore statue is simply sitting there. How boring.
 > The room is supported on all sides by many marble columns that seem to be crumbling due to their age. Little else is here, except for small green beetles scurrying to and fro on the floor.
 > You can't go forward! The hobgoblin is blocking your way, silly.
